        <p>Frogs are amphibians, meaning they live in and out of water. Frogs are born as tadpoles, who live in water and breathe through gills like fish. As they mature into adults, they grow legs and can walk and hop out of the water. This is called metamorphosis.</p>
        <p>Adult frogs have long legs and webbed feet. Their skin can absorb water and can help them breathe.  Because of this, they can stay still for long periods waiting for prey. Frogs vary in size, but are generally no larger than your hand.</p>
