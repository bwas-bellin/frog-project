        <h1>Mating and Reproduction</h1>
        <p><em>What is the gestational period of the animal?</em></p>
        <p>Depending on the temperature of the water it can take anywhere from 1 to 3 week for a frogs to hatch into tadpoles.</p>
            
        <p><em>How many offspring does it typically have at a time?</em></p>

        <p>Female frogs can lay up to 4000 eggs at a time, that's a lot of brothers and sisters!</p>
            
        <p><em>How long do the offspring live with the parent?</em></p>

        <p>Frogs don't raise their tadpoles so after baby frogs hatch they are on their own in the world!</p>
