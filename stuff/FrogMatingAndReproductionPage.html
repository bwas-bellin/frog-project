        <h1>Frog Families: How Frogs Grow Up!</h1>
        <p>Hello, young explorers! Let's jump into the world of frogs again and learn about how frog families grow. üê∏</p>
        
        <h2>Frog Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>Did you know that frogs have a very interesting way of growing up? Let's find out how!</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> It all starts when a mommy frog lays lots of tiny eggs in the water.</li>
            <li><strong>Tadpoles:</strong> These eggs hatch into tadpoles, baby frogs that look like little fish.</li>
            <li><strong>Growing Up:</strong> Tadpoles grow legs and lose their tails as they turn into adult frogs.</li>
            <li><strong>Adult Frogs:</strong> They can now hop on land and swim in water, without tails.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Frog Families</h2>
        <p>Mommy and daddy frogs don't stay with their babies. The tadpoles learn to take care of themselves.</p>
        
        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>Frogs lay hundreds of eggs at once, and the time it takes for a tadpole to become a frog varies.</p>
        
        <h2>Fun Activity</h2>
        <p>Can you draw the life cycle of a frog? Start with eggs and show how they turn into tadpoles and then into adult frogs!</p>
