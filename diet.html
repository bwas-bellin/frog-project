        <p>Frogs are carnivorous animals that feed on a variety of insects and other invertebrates. They use their long, sticky tongues to catch their prey and swallow it whole. Depending on the species and the size of the frog, they may eat crickets, grasshoppers, locusts, caterpillars, worms, bloodworms, brine shrimp, blackworms, or even mice. Frogs need to eat live food that is less wide than their head, and they also need to get enough calcium and other nutrients from their diet. Some frogs are aquatic, some are semi-aquatic, and some are terrestrial, and their diet may vary accordingly. Frogs are generalist predators that will eat almost anything that moves and fits in their mouth.</p>
